# Order Management System

This project is an Order Management System developed using Spring Boot and modern Java technologies, designed with a modular architecture. It includes production-ready features such as advanced logging, validation, and API documentation.

## 🚀 Project Structure & Modular Approach

The project is designed with an "Independent Modules" architecture. This ensures that each feature is isolated under its own package. When exploring the codebase, you will see the following structure:

- **`auth`**: Authentication, Login/Register operations, and Token management.
- **`user`**: User profile management and user-specific operations.
- **`order`**: (Under development) Order management module.
- **`config`**: Security configurations and application settings affecting the whole system.
- **`common`**: Exception handling and utility classes used by all modules.

Thanks to this structure, any module of the project can be easily ported to another project or developed independently.

## 🛠 Technologies & Libraries

The project features a comprehensive stack of modern technologies:

### Core Infrastructure

- **Java 17**: The comprehensive LTS Java version.
- **Spring Boot 3.2**: Framework for fast and secure web application development.
- **PostgreSQL**: Powerful and open-source relational database.
- **Maven**: Project dependency and build management.

### Security

- **Spring Security**: Industry-standard security framework.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Stateless authentication mechanism.
- **BCrypt**: Secure password hashing algorithm.

### Data Management & Validation

- **Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)**: ORM layer for database operations.
- **Spring Validation**: Ensures data integrity by validating API request inputs (Pattern, NotBlank, Size, etc.).

### Monitoring & Documentation

- **Spring Boot Actuator**: Used for monitoring application health (Health Check) and metrics.
- **OpenAPI / Swagger (SpringDoc)**: Automatically generates API documentation and provides a test interface.
- **SLF4J & Logback**: Integrated advanced logging infrastructure. All critical system events and errors are logged in detail.

### Productivity

- **Lombok**: Reduces boilerplate code by automatically generating Getters, Setters, Constructors, etc.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

We recommend using **Docker** to run the project in your local environment most easily.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Make sure [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is installed and running on your machine.
- Clone the project:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/username/order-management.git
  cd order-management
  ```

### 2. Environment Variables (.env)

The project reads settings from the `.env` file. Create your own `.env` file by copying the example:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
copy .env.example .env

# Linux / Mac
cp .env.example .env
```

You can open the created `.env` file with a text editor and make necessary changes (default settings are suitable for Docker).

### 3. Start the Application (Docker)

Run the following command to start both the database and the application at once:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This process might take some time on the first run as it downloads the database image and application dependencies.

- Application URL: `http://localhost:8080`
- Swagger UI (Documentation): `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html` (Available when service is running)

### 4. Development Environment (Optional)

If you wish to run it via an IDE (IntelliJ, VS Code, etc.) without Docker:

1.  Create a PostgreSQL database locally.
2.  Update `DB_HOST` in the `.env` file or `application.yaml` to `localhost`.
3.  Start the project by running the `OrderManagementApplication.java` file via your IDE.
